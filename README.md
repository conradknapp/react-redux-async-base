## Base React-Redux-Async App

I borrowed the template I made for the React-Redux Base App(https://github.com/conradknapp/react-redux-base-app) and added Redux Promise to create a simple starter repo for projects that intend to use the Redux store when working extensively with async data.

The initial setup allows you to search Github users with the Github API and appends the returned user data to a table.
